# Racial Diversity and Gender in Undergraduate STEM Programs

This study explores temporal trends in STEM completion rates (Bachelors) and potential predictive factors for women and under-represented minorities in post-secondary education. The data are drawn from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and include private non-profit 4-year+ institutions and public 4-year+ institutions.

Example questions:  

* Do measures of racial diversity among STEM graduates vary in relation to institutional characteristics and expenditures?

* Do institutions with high STEM diversity scores graduate proportionally more women each year than those with low scores?

* Have undergraduate STEM programs become progressively more inclusive with regard to race and gender over the past decade? 

Project status:

* Compiled and cleaned annual Stem completion data for ~1800 institutions covering the period 2010-2020
* Designed and deployed an interactive web application to facilitate monitoring of STEM diversity scores within/across institutions. See: (https://stem-div.herokuapp.com/) 
* Currently developing/testing explantory models for longitudinal data to address key research questions. 
* updates to github respository are ongoing. 

Results of this work will be relevant to campus officers and executive administrators, STEM faculty, industry recruiters, prospective students.
